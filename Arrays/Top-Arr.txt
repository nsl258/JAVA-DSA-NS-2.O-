| 1️⃣ | **Container With Most Water**    | Classic 2-pointer problem. Easy to grasp. Asked frequently in product interviews. |
| 2️⃣ | **Product of Array Except Self** | Tests prefix/suffix concept. Common in Microsoft, Amazon interviews.              |
| 3️⃣ | **Maximum Product Subarray**     | Variation of Kadane’s algorithm. Combines positive/negative product tracking.     |
| 4️⃣ | **Trapping Rain Water**          | Good simulation + prefix-max concept. Often asked in mid-level rounds.            |
| 5️⃣ | **Count Inversions in Array**    | Mergesort-based. Classic for learning divide and conquer + sorting trick.         |
